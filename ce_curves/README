The folder 'strain' has the strain sensitivity curves for the compact
binary (cb) and post-merger (pm) configurations for CE1 and CE2 with 10,
20, 30, and 40 km long arms. The first column is frequency in Hz and the
second column is the ASD in 1/rtHz. These curves are generated with
pygwinc using the yaml parameter files in the folder 'parameters'. The
choice of parameters for each configuration is described in CE-T2000007.

Curves for ET, Voyager, A+, AdVirgo+, and KAGRA+ are also included.
The Voyager compact binary is the current Voyager design. The Voyager
post-merger is post-merger optimized in the same way CE is. The parameters
for Voyager are also included in 'parameters'. The default A+ parameters
are used and are not included.

The curves for CE, Voyager, and A+ are generated by pygwinc-ce commit
c49a375dd2e549bd1fd57351b91e39405a30c212
on branch dev-ce-sus.

ET is the ET-D design for a single interferometer retrieved from
https://tds.virgo-gw.eu/?content=3&r=14065
and does not include corrections for two interferometers and 60 deg arms.
